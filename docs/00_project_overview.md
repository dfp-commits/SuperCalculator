# Project Overview

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a **web-accessible calculator** with both **standard** and **scientific** modes. This project demonstrates **full-stack development** using AI-assisted coding (Cursor), including the front-end interface, back-end logic, and temporary history storage (2 days retention). It is primarily a learning and experimentation platform for software development in the AI age.

## 2. Problem Statement
Without this system, users lack access to a simple, fully functional **web calculator** that combines standard and scientific functionality while retaining a history of past calculations for up to 2 days. Many existing calculators do not provide persistent session history or easy web deployment. This project solves that gap by providing a lightweight, persistent calculator suitable for casual use and learning.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- Front-end user interface for standard and scientific calculator modes  
- Back-end logic for calculation processing  
- Temporary history retention for a maximum of 2 days  
- Web deployment for public access  
- Full-stack development using AI-assisted coding with Cursor  
- Version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub  

### Out of Scope
- Collection or storage of personal user information  
- Advanced security features (authentication, encryption)  
- Mobile-specific UI optimizations (desktop-first approach)  
- Integration with external financial or scientific services  
- Long-term data retention beyond 2 days  

## 4. Users / Consumers
- End users: anyone accessing the calculator via the web  
- Internal services: backend services handling calculation logic and history storage  
- External systems: none at this stage; future API integrations possible  

## 5. Assumptions
- **Technical assumptions:**  
  - Users have access to a modern web browser  
  - Backend can store temporary logs for up to 2 days  
  - AI-assisted coding (Cursor) will generate functional and maintainable code  

- **Business assumptions:**  
  - Users require a simple, publicly accessible calculator  
  - No sensitive or personal data will be handled at this stage  
  - The project is primarily educational and exploratory  

## 6. Success Criteria
- **Functional correctness:** calculator performs accurate computations for standard and scientific operations  
- **Performance expectations:** frontend responds quickly; backend processes calculations with low latency  
- **Security requirements:** minimal, as no personal information is collected  
- **Maintainability standards:** code is modular, readable, version-controlled, and follows documented coding standards
